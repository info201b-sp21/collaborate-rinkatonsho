## In this report we analyze the US election data from 2000 to 2020, sourced by Canvas, Tony McGovernâ€™s repo on Github, census fips code, and Github. We pick patterns and trends in this data

## A function that takes state and returns total votes for that state
```{r}
describedata <- function(electionstate) {
  elections %>%
    filter(state == electionstate) %>%
    summarise(totalvotes = sum(totalvotes)) %>%
    pull(totalvotes)
}
```

## A function that takes total votes and produces a mean for that year
```{r}
Mean <- function(electionmean) {
	elections %>%
    filter(state == electionmean) %>%
    summarise(totalvotes = mean(totalvotes)) %>%
    pull(totalvotes)
}
```

## A function that takes in total votes and population to calculate the voterturnout
```{r}
voterturnout <- funtion(voterto){
  elections %>%
    filter(totalvotes, population == voterto) %>%
    summarise(totalvotes, population == totalvotes/population*100)%>%
    pull(totalvotes, population)
  }
```
